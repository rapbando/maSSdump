# maSSdump
Tool for harvesting common names from SSL  certificates providing IP ranges  (scanner/enumerator for secure sites) 
#!/usr/bin/sh

This script requires two main tools:

`MASSCAN` https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan /
`CNDUMP` https://github.com/bruston/cndump 

and some unix utilities.

INSTALLATION:

It is reccomended to install cloning main tools from github,
if you are in a hurry and/or have already masscan (i.e. from KALI) you can use my CNDUMP binary (after flagging it secure for execution).



USAGE: `sudo maSSdump.sh xx.xx.xx.xx/xx`
